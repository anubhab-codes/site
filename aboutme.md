My name is Anubhab Ghosh

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- Currently working on Identity & Access Management, DevOps platforms, and applied AI in production systems.
- Open to collaborating on practical problems in IAM, DevOps automation, and data-driven systems.
- Happy to talk about Identity (IGA, Authn, Authz), DevOps, Data Science, and Agile engineering.
- I prefer simple explanations and clear reasoning over diagrams and buzzwords.
- Serial blunderer at chess, still learning the hard way.
- Long-time Chelsea FC supporter — suffering builds character.
