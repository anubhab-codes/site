My name does not matter that much.

- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- Currently working on Identity problems, DevOps platforms, and applied AI.
- Open to collaborating on practical problems in IAM, DevOps automation, and data-driven systems.
- Happy to talk about Identity (IGA, IAM), DevOps, Data Science, and Agile engineering.
  
- _Serial blunderer at chess, still learning the hard way._
- _Long-time Chelsea FC supporter — suffering builds character._

### I prefer clarity over articulation.
